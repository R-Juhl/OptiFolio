-----v1.0+-----

First up:
- make dev environment workable (for instance the api base url should be localhost in dev env)


Invest Plan Excel

    - should take changes in Current shares, monthly surplus, stock prices, and fees into account
- Add method of updating stock prices in invest plan
- VBA code:
    - add period selector using drop-down w. vba in invest plan and dynamically change the appearance and function of invest plan
    - more logic to handle low surplus amounts by batching purchases, etc.
    - develop more sophisticated functions/algoritms for minimizing fees in monthly orders (batching purchases through multi-period planning (need solver??))
    - restructure everyting, what is saved in cells, what vba should handle what functions, etc. (regarding fees, surplus, stock prices, etc.)
- Design and formatting
    - Add net shares column to periods, and a funds required column
    - add total row for each period
    - make printable (define section(s)) ?
    - locked cells?

    *Create and link to a blog page (on app or my website) that details why this is a sound decision
- More functionality and user-configuration of Invest. plan

- Remove investplan component when user makes changes to portfolio?
    *currently some bugs

General changes and fixes

    *How to modify pie chart illustration??
    *Bar graph?

    *probably will need GPT prompting to find relevant data sources for whatever stock the user wants to research
- SSL on subdomain

Visual
- ResponsiveContainers for recharts elemements for dynamically adjusting to res
- Fix hover zoom on pie chart. Ideally to zoom on slices w. label popup if possible
- Links and popups on legend text/elements with explainers?


-----Bugs and fixes-----

fix endpoints being hit/reached multiple times /api/generate-excel and /api/get-stock-prices , maybe more

Errors when making quick selection changes (multiple)

Also many scenarios where it does not automatically recompute and redisplay outputs (daterange, possibly more?).

Adjust user facing error messaging behavior. Different scenarios, multiple error handling, etc.

Fix bug with Reach Hook useCallback missing dependencies
Implement useCallback: const computeOptimalPortfolio = useCallback(async (currentController) => {
And add dependencies: , [selectedStocks, startDate, endDate]);
And fix the bugs that then occur. Something for a rainy day.
