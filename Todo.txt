Todo:

Add handling of when user-specified date range does not include historical data of one or more stocks (pre-ipo)
*output message to user saying this

Fix bug with incorrect computations and resulting weights when adding specific tickers and/or changing date range

Also a problem where it seems weights are computed correctly for a tangency portfolio, but the legend for the pie chart indicates, for instance, 100% allocation to a stock when this is clearly not the case

Do not display efficient frontier plot when only 1 stock selected (not relevant)



Add zoom on pie chart slices ?? w. label popup if possible

Add capital and convert optimal portfolio weights into target number of shares (rounded down)
Add graph showing expected capital from now until retirement or some x years into future based on exp ret.

Add shorting option
How to modify pie chart illustration??

For stock target and planning: Use share counts after rounding down to recalibrate target shares (effectively use leftover capital after rounding and optimize with this constraint) - will require recomputation

Add RRA levels into the app using the risk-slider
User will be able to chose portfolios from the frontier depending on their chosen risk aversian (RRA) level
*Make sure that current points on the frontier match with these RRA levels. Same number of points. When risk level changes the frontier updates automatically
Move risk level down to stock selection (or below frontier perhaps?) and consider deleting experience level funct.

Add budgeting functionality.
Monthly budget to invest in stocks
Current portfolio input option (otherwise default to 0). Holdings of other stocks than optimal (chosen portfolio) ignored.
Add option to add custom transaction costs per stock purchase (broker fees)
Then use all this data to output table w. stock purchase plan per month. Also add functionality to download as excel for offline use

Add lifecycle functionality to budgeting element. Option for user to specify increase in risk aversion that scales with time based on time to retirement
*Will be incorporated in stock purchase plan

Add more stock selection options/inspo and incorporate GPT api calls into this based on user's interest, desired industries, etc.
Will be a challenge to get right output of ChatGPT (with great detailed prompt) to return available stocks and tickers, and how to convert these into possible user selections

Add research elements to the app where the user can read more about stocks based on their selection or GPT generated suggestions

Add maximization of data range option/button. Extend start date to earliest IPO of stock selection. End date to most recent data.

Incorporate easy upload of portfolio to adjust weights based on more recent historical data


Notes/bugs and more:
Sometimes a bug with the output weights (seems to only be the pie chart and its legend) when switching around between different stocks and dates
