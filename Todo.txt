Todo:

Add some cool sounding (chat gpt generated) disclaimer saying this is NFA and in reality people should not built their portfolio exactly like this
Though it does provide inspiration and important insights. Also valuable to evaluate one's current portfolio
Add subtle "NFA: Read Disclaimer" text/button that generates popup with this text if possible



Table with individual stocks expected returns and volatility below pie chart.
Then some cool way to illustrate the expected return and volatility of the optimal (later the user-chosen) portfolio

If possible, add slight zoom hover effect on mouse over legends and pie chart

Add shorting option

Add custom stock selection system from yfinance library - some cool design

Add capital and convert optimal portfolio weights into target number of shares (rounded down)
Add graph showing expected capital from now until retirement or some x years into future based on exp ret.

Use share counts after rounding to recalibrate target shares - will likely require recomputation

Add RRA levels into the app using the risk-slider
User will be able to chose portfolios from the frontier depending on their chosen risk aversian (RRA) level
*Make sure that current points on the frontier match with these RRA levels. Same number of points. When risk level changes the frontier updates automatically
Move risk level down to stock selection and consider deleting experience level funct.

Add budgeting functionality.
Monthly budget to invest in stocks
Current portfolio input option (otherwise default to 0). Holdings of other stocks than optimal (chosen portfolio) ignored.
Add option to add custom transaction costs per stock purchase (broker fees)
Then use all this data to output table w. stock purchase plan per month. Also add functionality to download as excel for offline use

Add lifecycle functionality to budgeting element. Option for user to specify increase in risk aversion that scales with time based on time to retirement
*Will be incorporated in stock purchase plan

Add more stock selection options/inspo and incorporate GPT api calls into this based on user's interest, desired industries, etc.
Will be a challenge to get right output of ChatGPT (with great detailed prompt) to return available stocks and tickers, and how to convert these into possible user selections

Add research elements to the app where the user can read more about stocks based on their selection or GPT generated suggestions
